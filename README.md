# API Services (API-S)

This repository hosts script examples to developers looking to take advantage of NetApp's OnCommand API Services framework.

## Getting Started

Look at the files located in Examples folder for different script language formats.

### Prerequisities

OnCommand API-S must be installed and configured in your environment to properly use the scripts.  Additionally, depending on the example, additional libraries may be needed in order to utilize REST operations.  For example, the requests library for Python, RestClient for Ruby, etc.
